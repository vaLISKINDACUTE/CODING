          <h1>Hi, thanks for visiting my website.</h1>
          <p>i have put so much work into this enjoyable project and im super happy with the results i did struggle with some
              parts but i always knew i could turn to my teacher for any help or look it up myself i have included hmtl, css and i tiny bit of
              javascript in this project.
          </p>

          <p>working on this project i have learned so many skills such as the use of flexbox, a more indepth view into css, importing fonts,
              and most of all i have learned how to build a functioning website. I am very satisfied with my content in this website and the amount
              i managed to achieve in 3 weeks!.</p>
